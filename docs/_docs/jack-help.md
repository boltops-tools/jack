title: jack help

You can run help for quick help information right at the cli.  Example:

```sh
jack help
```

You can append `help`, `-h` or `--help` to the end of any command to get more help information about that specific command.  These all work.

```sh
jack get help
jack apply --help
jack create -h
```

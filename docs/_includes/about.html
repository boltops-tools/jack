                    <p>Jack is a tool to manage AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. Jack is a wrapper tool around the aws eb cli3 tool. Jack allows you to create environments using the saved template configuration file generated by <code>eb config save</code>. Jack moves these generated config file to the jack/cfg folder of your project and manages the the config files from there.</p>

                    <p>Jack provides a <code>jack config apply</code> command to update the Elastic Beanstalk environment. Before uploading the new configuration to Elastic Beanstalk jack first downloads the current configuration and then does a diff on the changes that you are about apply. This gives a helpful preview of exactly will be change. This is particularly helpful when changes are made through the Elastic Beanstalk GUI by multiple developers and are out of sync with what you thought they were.</p>
